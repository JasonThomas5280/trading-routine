# Trade Log

**The most important file.** This is the agent's memory of every trade — what it bought, why, what stop was set, and what happened. Without this file, each routine would be stateless.

Entries are chronological. New entries appended to the bottom. **Never edit past entries** — log corrections as new entries referencing the original.
