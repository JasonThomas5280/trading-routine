# Watchlist

Rebuilt every Sunday by `/weekly-prep`. Refreshed each morning by `/pre-market`. Primary input to `/market-check` execution decisions.

**Format:** Ranked by conviction score descending. Top 8 candidates max (4 positions + 4 bench).

---

## ⚠️ ARCHIVED — Week of 2026-06-02 to 2026-06-06 — **STALE — rebuild via /weekly-prep on Sunday Jun 8**

> **Archived week of Jun 2–6.** Market state changed to 🔴 CORRECTION (Dist Day #6 Jun 5 confirmed Jun 8). All primary candidates below threshold. AVGO base destroyed. GOOGL removed. DELL/NVDA below 75. Full rebuild required Sunday Jun 8 — do NOT use this list for entry decisions.

**Built:** 2026-05-31 (Sun) — `/weekly-prep` | `research_source: websearch_fallback` (Alpaca: 403 Day 68, Perplexity: 403, Alpha Vantage: 403 — all three primary sources blocked; all data via WebSearch + cached prior-week fundamentals)

**Market direction:** 🟡 Uptrend Under Pressure (5/25 dist days → 4/25 Jun 2 after Apr 28 expiry) | **NO NEW LONG ENTRIES** until FTD confirmed
**SPY:** ~$756.44 (May 29 close) | **50d MA ~$740** (+2.2%) | **200d MA ~$722** (+4.7%) | ⚠️ Prior MA estimates corrected (50d was $689 — stale artifact)
**QQQ:** ~$737 | **50d MA ~$712** (+3.5%) | **200d MA ~$683** (+7.9%)

**Top sectors (4-week trailing RS, May 1 → May 29):**
1. **XLK Technology: #1** ✅ — 52-week high $191, AI/semiconductor dominant. `sector_momentum_warning` **CLEARED** — XLK BLACKOUT **LIFTED**. ARM +177% YTD, XLK +~20% May. Sector bonus restored for XLK names.
2. XLI Industrials: ~+8-12% — DELL AI servers +757% YoY confirms AI power/cooling cycle. VRT thesis confirmed but VRT price showing distribution.
3. XLE Energy: ~+5-8% — oil held ~$90-100 despite Iran deal uncertainty. JD Vance "not there yet."
4. ⚠️ **XLC Communication Services: DEMOTED to #4** — GOOGL -2.51% on May 29 ATH day (distribution into strength). XLC weakening. No sector bonus for XLC names.

**Blacklisted sectors:** None
**XLK status:** `sector_momentum_warning` CLEARED → **blackout LIFTED** (RRG confirmed leading/weakening via 52-week high price action)

**Universe scan:** DEGRADED — Alpaca + AV both blocked; cannot run `build-universe.sh`. Curated universe of 5 names.
**Candidates evaluated:** GOOGL, NVDA, DELL, ARM, MRVL
**Pre-filtered out:** AVBO (⛔ earnings Jun 3 = 2 trading days blackout), AMD (A-letter GAAP FY2023 EPS -36.9%), GE (float >800M + insufficient GAAP history), META (price data conflict unresolved), VRT (65/100 carry, below threshold), CAT ($931 > $500 ceiling), GS ($948 > $500 ceiling)
**Passed conviction ≥75: 0** — **ZERO for 8th consecutive week**
**Entry gates passed: 0** (market Under Pressure = no entries)

> **⚠️ 8th consecutive week with 0 candidates above conviction threshold.**
> This is NOT a rubric failure — it is information. XLC sector demotion pushed GOOGL below threshold; no other name has valid base + A-letter quality combination. Market transitioning; do NOT lower threshold. Patience is the position.

## ⚠️ UNDER PRESSURE POSTURE — NO NEW LONG ENTRIES

**Entry gate:** ALL LONG ENTRIES BLOCKED (Under Pressure; FTD not confirmed). SH/SQQQ hedge $625 queued — FIRST ORDER on Alpaca restore.

**This week's inflection path:**
- **Mon Jun 2:** APR 28 dist day expires → dist count 4/25 (still Under Pressure but one hurdle removed)
- **Tue-Wed Jun 3:** AVBO earnings AH → if beat (consensus $2.40 EPS/$22.11B rev) → potential FTD power-move Jun 4
- **Fri Jun 5:** NFP (96K est, unemployment 4.3%) → beat = FTD fuel; miss = dist day #6 risk → 🔴 Correction

### Primary Watchlist (score ≥75)

**NONE this week.** Zero candidates above conviction threshold. See bench for near-threshold names.

### Bench (below threshold — watching for score improvement, base formation, or FTD trigger)

| Rank | Symbol | Score | Sector | Status | Re-Score Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | DELL | **74/100** ⚠️ | XLK / AI Infra | 🟡 Post-earnings gap-up; no base yet | Alpaca+AV restore (A-letter GAAP confirmation) + 3-wk consolidation base | **NEW CANDIDATE — CLOSEST TO THRESHOLD.** Q1 FY2027: Rev $43.84B (+88% YoY), AI-Optimized Servers $16.1B (+757% YoY), EPS $4.86 vs $2.94 est. C:20 (EPS +90%+ YoY). A:7 (VMware amortization creates GAAP uncertainty — cannot confirm all 3 yrs ≥25%; ROE partial credit). N:15 (new ATH; AI server category genuinely new at this scale). S:10 (float headwind but massive volume on gap-up; institutional interest). L:15 (RS 95+; XLK #1 sector). I:7 (cached). Base:0 (earnings gap-up on May 29; need 3-wk consolidation post-gap). **Score would be 84/100 with confirmed base and A-letter AV data.** Pivot: est. $200-210 (consolidation zone above gap). Earnings: est. Aug/Sep (clear). `cached_fundamentals` `research_source: websearch_fallback`. |
| B2 | NVDA | **72/100** ⚠️ | XLK / Semis | 🟡 Post-earnings consolidation wk 3; base forming | Base completion (est. Jun 10-Jul 3) + Alpaca+AV restore | C:20 (Q1 FY2027 EPS +85%+ YoY). A:15 (FY2024+FY2025+FY2026 all ≥25% GAAP). N:10 (near ATH but China H20 = zero permanently = no new market = -5pts). S:5 (massive float; $80B buyback). L:15 (RS 90+; XLK #1 sector — SECTOR BONUS **RESTORED**). I:7 (cached). Base:0 (consolidation wk 3; est. cup-with-handle Jun 10-Jul 3; pivot TBD). **Score with base: 82/100 ✅.** Price ~$211, ATH $235.74 (May 14). Earnings: ~Aug 2026 (clear). `research_source: websearch_fallback`. |
| ~~B3~~ | ~~GOOGL~~ | ~~72/100~~ | ~~XLC / Communication~~ | ❌ **REMOVED Jun 3** — $80B dilutive equity raise (Jun 1) breaks S-letter thesis | — | **REMOVED.** Alphabet announced $80B equity raise: $40B ATM (Q3 2026) + $30B underwritten + $10B Berkshire @ $351.81/sh. Massively dilutive — contradicts buyback/supply thesis. S-letter revised down 10→0-5 → estimated score 72→65-70/100. Stock under pressure overnight; trading ~$352-376 est. = 7-13% below $404 pivot and widening. XLC still #4 sector (no sector bonus). No base forming at these levels. Path to re-entry: stock must rebuild base post-dilution + XLC returns to top-3 + score reaches 75+. Remove entirely from bench; re-evaluate at /weekly-prep when conditions improve. |
| B4 | AVGO | **est. 65–72/100 (REVISED DOWN)** ⚠️ | XLK / Technology | ⚠️ **POST-EARNINGS CRASH — needs new base — re-score Jun 9 (lower expectations)** | New base formation from ~$405–415 support + Jun 9 re-score | **⚠️ MAJOR CORRECTION (Jun 5 /pre-market):** Prior estimate "+6.03% AH → $505–510" was WRONG. Timeline: Q2 FY2026 $22.19B rev (+48% YoY, +88% net income). Q3 guide $29.4B BEAT vs $28.5B cons. AI rev +200% Q3. BUT: management did NOT raise 2027 AI revenue guidance (prior: "in excess of $100B") → violent sell-off. Jun 3 AH: initial pop +6% → reversed -14% from $477 close during earnings call. Jun 4 intraday: $405.51–$496.02. Jun 5 pre-market: **$413.45**. Stock −13.3% from Jun 3 session close. L-letter DAMAGED (market punishing -14% = weak relative strength). Base DESTROYED (need new 3–4 week base from ~$405–415 support). Score reset: C:20 (Q2 beat) + A:est.10 + N:12 (Q3 AI growth 200%) + S:5 (float >500M) + L:5 (RS severely damaged, XLK #1 sector bonus applies but offset by -14% AH reaction) + I:7 + Base:0 = **est. 59–67/100** without base. With base (+10): **69–77/100** — borderline. Citi $500, Evercore $582 PTs (may be revised down). Re-score Jun 9 unchanged but **NO LONGER HIGH-PRIORITY** — must see price stabilization + base formation before entry planning. |

---

### Entry Execution Plan — Week of Jun 2-6

**Entry gate: ⛔ ZERO new long entries** (market = Uptrend Under Pressure; Alpaca Day 68; no FTD)

**FIRST order on Alpaca restore:** Buy SH (inverse S&P −1×) ~$625 / 25% portfolio (Under Pressure hedge protocol)

**FTD confirmation triggers this week:**

| Day | Gate | Bullish setup | Bearish scenario |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mon Jun 2 | APR 28 dist expiry | Dist count → 4/25; ISM Mfg 53.3 est (beat = FTD fuel) | ISM miss = potential dist day #5 (of new 25-session window) |
| Tue/Wed Jun 3 | AVBO earnings AH | Beat $2.40 EPS / $22.11B rev → potential FTD Jun 4 (+1.25%+ on vol) | Revenue miss → gap-down → dist day #6 risk → 🔴 Correction |
| Thu Jun 4 | Post-AVBO reaction | Power move session on AI confidence → FTD confirmation | Sell-the-news repeat (MRVL, NVDA pattern) → no FTD |
| Fri Jun 5 | **NFP** | Jobs +96K+ on lower unemployment → FTD possible | Sub-80K print → recession signal → dist day #6 → 🔴 Correction |

**If FTD confirmed:**
→ 🟢 Confirmed Uptrend → exit SH hedge → immediately re-score DELL (est. 84/100 with base) and NVDA (current 72/100 — still needs base) → if AVBO earnings beat confirmed + XLK sector bonus + base forming: AVBO re-score Jun 9 could be first entry → via `trade-executor`

**If dist day #6 hits:**
→ 🔴 Correction → no new longs → SH/SQQQ $625 hedge → full cash until next FTD

### Removed / Changed this week

| Symbol | Reason |
|---|---|
| GOOGL B3 | **REMOVED Jun 3 /pre-market.** $80B dilutive equity raise (announced Jun 1): $40B ATM + $30B underwritten + $10B Berkshire Hathaway @ $351.81/share. Breaks S-letter thesis (massive new share issuance = opposite of buyback narrative; $40B ATM = continuous selling pressure through Q3). Score revised 72→est. 65-70/100. Stock ~7-13% below $404 pivot and drifting further. XLC still #4 sector. No realistic re-entry path until post-dilution base forms + XLC returns to top-3. |
| GOOGL W1→B3 | Previously: **DEMOTED to Bench B3** from Primary (May 31). XLC sector demotion (#2 → #4) cut L-letter 15→10 → conviction score 77→72 (below threshold). Additionally: -2.51% on May 29 ATH market day = distribution signal. Then removed entirely on Jun 3 (equity raise). |
| NVDA B1 | Moved to B2. DELL added as B1 (closer to threshold, stronger C-letter EPS beat). |
| META B4 | Removed — price data conflict persists (search shows $280-320, prior watch showed $580-620). Cannot score reliably without Alpaca. Float 2.5B+ = S-letter structural headwind regardless. Re-evaluate only when Alpaca restores and confirms actual price. |

## ⚠️ ARCHIVED — Week of 2026-05-26 to 2026-05-30 — rebuilt via /weekly-prep Sun May 31

> **Archived week of May 26–30.**

## ACTIVE — Week of 2026-05-26 to 2026-05-30

**Built:** 2026-05-24 (Sun) — `/weekly-prep` | `research_source: websearch_fallback` (Alpaca: 403 Day 54, Perplexity: 403, Alpha Vantage: 403 — all three primary sources blocked; all data via WebSearch + cached prior-week fundamentals)

**Market direction:** 🟡 Uptrend Under Pressure (5/25 dist days) | **NO NEW LONG ENTRIES** until FTD confirmed
**SPY:** ~$747 (May 22 est.) | 50d MA $689 (+8.4%) | 200d MA $676 (+10.5%)
**QQQ:** $716.97 | 50d SMA $638 (+12.4%) | 200d SMA $618 (+16.0%)

**Top sectors (4-week trailing RS, Apr 24 → May 22):**
1. XLI Industrials: ~+16% (VRT, AI power/cooling; RRG leading quadrant)
2. XLC Communication Services: ~+12-15% (GOOGL; AI cloud; RS 95+)
3. XLE Energy: ~+8-12% (Iran deal catalyst; Brent elevated)
4. ⚠️ XLK Technology: BLACKOUT — RRG lagging; sector_momentum_warning ongoing

**Blacklisted sectors:** None
**XLK status:** `sector_momentum_warning` → **blackout maintained** until RRG confirms leading/weakening quadrant

**Universe scan:** DEGRADED — Alpaca + AV both blocked; cannot run `build-universe.sh`. Curated universe of 8 names based on sector research.
**Candidates evaluated:** GOOGL, VRT, NVDA, AVGO, GE, META, DE, CCJ
**Pre-filters:** CAT ($931 > $500 price ceiling — disqualified), GE (float >800M + A-letter spin-off history), DE (lagging sector momentum)
**Passed conviction ≥75: 1** (GOOGL 77/100) | Entry gates passed: **0** (market Under Pressure)

> **⚠️ 7th consecutive week with only 1 candidate above conviction threshold.** Rubric is working. Do NOT lower thresholds. This is information: the universe is thin in a transitioning market.

---

## ⚠️ UNDER PRESSURE POSTURE — NO NEW LONG ENTRIES

**Entry gate:** ALL LONG ENTRIES BLOCKED (5/25 dist days → Under Pressure). Hedge SH/SQQQ $625 queued — FIRST ORDER on Alpaca restore.

**This week's inflection: FTD window is open (May 26–28).**
- If FTD confirmed → state flips to 🟢 Confirmed Uptrend → evaluate GOOGL immediately (base approaching wk 5)
- If no FTD by May 28 → rally attempt window closes; monitor SPY $733.39 Day 1 low for undercut
- If dist day #6 hits → 🔴 Correction again; no longs; full SH/SQQQ hedge

### Primary Watchlist (score ≥75 — watching for FTD confirmation + base completion)

| Rank | Symbol | Conviction | Sector | Base / Setup | Pivot | Stop if Entered | Earnings | Buy-Zone Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | GOOGL | **77/100** ✅ | XLC / Communication | ⏳ FORMING flat base ($387-403 zone; **wk 4-5** — need 1-2 more wks for validity) | ~$404 (est., upon base completion) | entry × 0.93 (~$375) | Q2 ~July 2026 (~42d) | 🟡 WATCHING — 3.8% below $404 pivot; entry requires FTD confirmed + base wk 5-7 + vol ≥+40% + Alpaca restored | **Lead candidate for NEXT Confirmed Uptrend.** C:20 (GAAP EPS +81% YoY; Cloud +63%; net income $62.6B), A:10 (2 of 3 yrs ≥25%; ROE 31.83%), N:15 (near 52wk high; Gemini AI; Pentagon; $70B buyback), S:10 (float 12B headwind; buyback active; vol in base declining=constructive), L:15 (RS 95+; XLC #2 sector), I:7 (65%+ inst, increasing). Base:0 (forming wk 4-5; need wk 5-7). Score would be **87/100** with confirmed base. `cached_fundamentals` `research_source: websearch_fallback`. **First order on Alpaca restore: SH hedge $625. Second: GOOGL entry on FTD+base.** |

Base:0. Total 65/100. Path: GAAP confirmed (+5) + base confirmed (+10) = **80/100** ✅.

Score 63/100 — dual blockage: A-letter + XLK. **Earnings June 3: BLACKOUT starts May 28 (≤5 trading days).** Next re-score: week of June 9 post-earnings. Citi $500, Evercore $582 PT. `sector_momentum_warning`. |
| B4 | META | **~45-55/100** ❌ | XLC / Communication | 🟡 Base forming (est. wk 20+ from May 2025 ATH correction) | Base completion + price data confirmed (agent search shows ~$300-320; prior watchlist showed $580-620 — ⚠️ DATA CONFLICT. Do NOT score until Alpaca+AV restore resolves.) | ⚠️ **PRICE DATA CONFLICT**: Prior watchlist (May 17) estimated $580-620 (ABOVE $500 price ceiling = would disqualify). New websearch shows $280-320 range. Conflict too large (>$200). HOLD VIA WATCHLIST — FULL RE-SCORE REQUIRED when Alpaca+AV restore to confirm actual price. If >$500: disqualified. If <$500: re-score. Do NOT enter on uncertain data. Float 2.5B+ = S-letter headwind regardless. |

### Entry Execution Plan — Week of May 26-30

**Entry gate: ⛔ ZERO new long entries** (market = Uptrend Under Pressure; Alpaca Day 55)

**FIRST order on Alpaca restore:** Buy SH (inverse S&P −1×) ~$625 / 25% portfolio (Under Pressure hedge protocol)
- SH preferred over SQQQ (lower leverage decay for account size)
- Sizing: $625 / SH current price (est. ~$16-18 range)

**FTD confirmation triggers this week:**

| Day | Gate | Bullish setup | Bearish scenario |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tue May 26 | **FTD Day 5** | Iran deal announcement → gap-up open ≥+1.25% on above-avg vol = **FTD confirmed** | No deal; flat-to-down = Day 5 not confirmed; window continues |
| Wed May 27 | **FTD Day 6** | MRVL/CRM earnings beat + general momentum ≥+1.25% on vol | Earnings miss = dist day risk (would be #6 → Correction) |
| Thu May 28 | **FTD Day 7 (LAST)** | PCE April soft → rate cut signals = FTD fuel | Hot PCE = dist day risk #6; AVGO blackout starts |
| Fri May 29 | Window closes | If no FTD: rally attempt remains alive but watch for $733.39 SPY undercut | SPY closes below $733.39 = rally attempt reset |

**If FTD confirmed this week:**
→ State flips to 🟢 Confirmed Uptrend → Execute SH sell (hedge off) → Immediately evaluate GOOGL (base wk 5 = potentially valid flat base, min 5wk) → Re-score GOOGL with base data → If base confirmed + vol +40% + Alpaca restored → enter GOOGL via `trade-executor`

**If dist day #6 hits this week:**
→ 🔴 Market in Correction → No new longs → SH/SQQQ hedge highest priority → Cash preservation → Wait for new rally attempt + FTD

---

### Removed this week

| Symbol | Reason |
|---|---|
| GE (GE Aerospace) | **Evaluated new; rejected.** Score ~43/100. A-letter: GE Aerospace spun off April 2024 — insufficient 3-year standalone GAAP history. Float ~860M shares (>500M = S-letter headwind). Score fails threshold even in best case. Fundamental story (orders +87%, revenue +25%) is strong but CAN SLIM rubric requires history. Re-evaluate after FY2026 full year report (est. Jan 2027) when 3-year track record exists. |
| CAT (Caterpillar) | **DISQUALIFIED** — price $931 > $500 ceiling per TRADING-STRATEGY.md. Same rule as GS, GEV. |
| DE (Deere) | **Sector laggard** — only +41% vs CAT +93% last 12 months; no CAN SLIM breakout setup. |
| CCJ (Cameco) | **Rejected** — uranium mining cyclical. Not a CAN SLIM growth-earnings story. |

## ⚠️ UNDER PRESSURE POSTURE — NO NEW LONG ENTRIES

**Entry gate status:** ALL LONG ENTRIES BLOCKED by market state (5/25 dist days → Uptrend Under Pressure). Hedge SH/SQQQ queued at $625 / 25% portfolio pending Alpaca restore.

**Scan stats (websearch_fallback degraded):**
- Universe targeted: 8 names (GOOGL, AVGO, NVDA, VRT, META, AMD, GS, PWR)
- Could not run: build-universe.sh (requires Alpaca + Alpha Vantage, both blocked)
- Passed conviction ≥75: **1** (GOOGL 77/100)
- Entry gates passed: **0** (market Under Pressure = no entries)
- Rejection breakdown:
  - Price ceiling ($10-$500) fail: GS ($948)
  - Earnings blackout (≤5d): NVDA (May 20 AH)
  - Conviction <75: AVGO (62-67), META (~45-55), AMD (66), VRT (est. 55-75, insufficient GAAP data), PWR (~52-60, A-letter annual growth 17.3% < 25%)
  - Market gate (Under Pressure): would have blocked GOOGL entry even if base were present

**This is the 5th consecutive week of 0 actionable setups.** Rubric is working as designed — do NOT lower thresholds to fill slots.

**The week ahead is the highest-stakes inflection point since the April 8 FTD:**
- NVDA earnings May 20 AH = binary event. Beat + H200 China confirmed + strong guidance → potential FTD May 21-22 → state recovery to Confirmed Uptrend. Miss/soft guidance → dist day #6 → 🔴 Market in Correction.
- First order on Alpaca restore (regardless of market state): SH ~$625 / 25% portfolio (hedge activation per Under Pressure protocol).

Base:0 — needs 3-5 more weeks of $387-405 consolidation. Antitrust flags ongoing (USA TODAY lawsuit May 12, UK display ad, EU) — Proposal 7 not yet approved but monitoring. **MILESTONE: First conviction-passing name in 5 weeks of operation.

Score provisional: C:20 (massive EPS beat), A:est.15, N:est.10 (near ATH but China zero = no new market expansion), S:est.10, L:est.8-10 (muted post-earnings reaction is weak L signal), I:est.7, Base:0 (no new base post-earnings consolidation yet). Total est. **72-82/100** — range due to websearch_fallback data uncertainty. **China zero = permanent negative** for N-letter (no new market = -5pts). Needs: (1) new base to form (est. 2-4 weeks), (2) Alpaca+AV live confirmation, (3) FTD market recovery. Entry pivot: TBD (base must form first). `research_source: websearch_fallback`. |
| B2 | VRT | **est. 55-75/100** ⚠️ | XLI / Industrials | 🟡 NEEDS FORMAL SCORE (GAAP data insufficient) | Alpaca + AV restore for formal score | **NEW CANDIDATE — Vertiv Holdings.** AI power infrastructure leader (thermal mgmt, UPS, power for hyperscaler data centers). Q1 2026: Revenue +30% YoY (+23% organic), Americas +44%. Adjusted EPS $1.17 (+83% YoY). FY2026 guidance: $13.75B revenue (+34% YoY), adj. EPS $6.35 (+51% YoY). Sector: XLI (#2 — RRG leading). Price: $370.94 (May 15 close), ATH $379.94 (May 14) — near all-time high. ✅ price within $10-$500. Earnings July 29 ✅ (73 days out). **Score uncertainty:** A-letter GAAP annual EPS unconfirmed for FY2023 (VRT private equity history; possible low/negative FY2023 GAAP). If FY2023 GAAP ≥25%: estimated 72-80/100; if <25%: 55-65/100. Float ~380-400M shares (within range). N-letter: near ATH + AI data center = 10-15pts. **FORMAL canslim-screener REQUIRED when Alpaca + AV restore.** Potential top-3 candidate. `insufficient_data_flag`. `research_source: websearch_fallback`. |
| B3 | AVGO | **62-67/100** ❌ | XLK / Technology | 🔴 Score gate fails; XLK sector demoted to #4 | GAAP FY2023 revenue confirmed ≥25% + XLK sector recovery | Score: C:15 (AI semis +106% YoY; Q1 FY2026 revenue +29%; GAAP EPS unconfirmed — VMware amort.), A:10 (FY2023 revenue +8% = BELOW 25% threshold; ROE 33.37% saves +5), N:12 (est. near ATH; AI ASIC traction), S:5 (float >500M = 0; buyback unconfirmed), L:5 (RS strong but XLK sector #4 = sector penalty applied; `sector_momentum_warning`), I:6, Base:10 (flat base est.). **Total: 63/100** — well below threshold AND sector now blacklisted for new entries. Price: $422-439 range (May 17 per search). Wells Fargo $545 PT, 29 analysts Strong Buy. Earnings June 3 ✅ (17d out — safe). **Score improvement path:** GAAP EPS YoY confirmed ≥40% + XLK returns to top-3 sector. `sector_momentum_warning`. |
| B4 | META | **~45-55/100** ❌ | XLC / Communication | 🟡 BASE FORMING (8-9 months in; est. 4-6 more weeks) | Base completion + score re-check | Q1 2026: Revenue +33% YoY ($56B). But capex raise ($135B) caused -9% AH reaction. Stock recovery underway from May 2025 ATH ($796) correction. Price est. ~$580-620 range (May 15). Float 2.5B+ shares (S-letter headwind). Base still forming — massive distribution phase from ATH to May correction needs more consolidation. C:20 (if GAAP ≥80% YoY confirms), A:10 (need to verify), N:5 (not near 52wk high; capex overhang), S:0-5 (huge float), L:7, I:7, Base:0. Estimated 45-55/100. Re-score week of June 7 when base potentially completes. |

### Removed this week

| Symbol | Reason |
|---|---|
| GOOGL | ➡️ PROMOTED from Watchlist W1 to Primary Watchlist (score 77/100 passes threshold; now properly positioned as lead candidate) |
| GS | **DISQUALIFIED — price ceiling.** Goldman Sachs: $948.47 (May 15) > $500 maximum per TRADING-STRATEGY.md. Q1 2026 EPS $17.55 (+24% YoY), ROE 19.8% — excellent fundamentals, cannot trade at this price. Same rule as GEV. Flag for re-evaluation only if stock splits or price rule formally amended. |
| PWR | **A-letter fail.** Quanta Services: annual EPS growth forecast +17.3% < 25% CAN SLIM threshold. Q1 2026 GAAP EPS $1.45, backlog $48.5B (record), but forward growth does not meet criterion. |
| NVDA | **⛔ Earnings blackout** (May 13-20 AH). Re-evaluating May 21 post-earnings. H200 China clearance potential score-changer. |
| AVGO | Score 63/100 (below threshold) AND XLK sector demoted to #4 (sector_momentum_warning escalated to blackout). Dual blockage. |
| AMD | 66/100 carry-over (A-letter: GAAP FY2023 EPS −36.9%). Re-score earliest June 9 (one more GAAP quarter needed). |
| STX | No base formed. Price ~$700+ range. Re-score when cup-with-handle or flat base appears. |
| MU | Climax top (price $762-780 est., +39-43% extended above ~$546 pivot). Wait for base formation est. 6-8 weeks. |

### Entry Execution Plan — Week of May 18-22

**Entry gate: ⛔ ZERO new long entries** (market = Uptrend Under Pressure)

**Hedge activation (highest priority when Alpaca restores):**
- Buy SH (inverse S&P −1×) or SQQQ (inverse Nasdaq −3×) at ~$625 / 25% of $2,500 portfolio
- SH preferred (lower leverage decay for account size)
- Sizing: $625 / SH current price (est. $16-18 range)

**Watch triggers that could change posture this week:**

| Day | Event | Bullish scenario | Bearish scenario |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tue May 19 | HD earnings AM | Strong housing demand = consumer resilient | Miss = dist day risk |
| Wed May 20 | NVDA earnings AH + FOMC minutes | Data center >$80B + H200 China confirmed + strong guide → **FTD candidate May 21** | Miss/soft guide → dist day #6 → 🔴 Correction |
| Thu May 21 | WMT earnings AM | Consumer spending resilient | Miss = recession signal |
| Fri May 22 | U of Michigan Sentiment | Confidence recovery | Multi-month low = Correction reinforcement |

**If NVDA results trigger FTD (rally day +1.25%+ on higher volume within 4-7 days of rally attempt):**
→ State flips to 🟢 Confirmed Uptrend → Immediately evaluate GOOGL (if base at $403 pivot) + re-score NVDA → Enter best setup via trade-executor

**Distribution day #6 scenario (one more dist day):**
→ 🔴 Market in Correction → No new longs → Liquidate any positions (none currently) → Deploy SH/SQQQ hedge fully → Cash preservation until FTD
